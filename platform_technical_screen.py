    Sort the packages using the following criteria:

    - A package is bulky if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or when one of its dimensions is greater or equal to 150 cm.
    - A package is heavy when its mass is greater or equal to 20 kg.

    Dispatch the packages in the following stacks:
    - STANDARD: standard packages (those that are not bulky or heavy) can be handled normally.
    - SPECIAL: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
    - REJECTED: packages that are **both** heavy and bulky are rejected.
